title: Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)
---

This section of the documentations contains the "Software Requirements
Specifications (SRS)" for Terox. All feature enhancements and related
development on the project will be based on the criterias listed here on this
document. Any other feature request or behaviour of the tool which can be
considered out-of-scope of this document will not be worked upon. In case, a
functionality or behaviour has been heavily requested by community members, the
document will first have to be updated accordingly before development on the
functionality can start taking shape.

### Purpose

Terox is a Command-Line Interface tool for managing software development
templates. The intention of developing the tool is to make the first step of the
Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) easy and streamlined. Terox will attempt
to achieve that goal by providing its users with an ability to download
predefined "_project templates_" and setting it up for software development!

### Scope

Terox takes inspiration from existing tools like
[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io),
[Create React App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev) and such but does not
intend to replace them in any manner or ways. Although it does attempt to
provide a better UI/UX to its users through the following offerings:

1. Provide speed and efficiency (wherever possible).
2. Streamlined and intuitive CLI commands.
3. General-purpose usage and application.

If Terox is missing a functionality or two from your favourite project template
generator, then please
[open an issue/discussion thread](https://github.com/Weburz/terox/issues/new)
stating the requirements and we will look into it promptly.

### References

The following resources and reference materials will be useful while developing
(or even using) Terox;

1. The [Cobra](https://cobra.dev) CLI framework used to develop Terox.
2. A detailed guideline on writing intuitive and useful CLI applications -

### Summary

Terox is a CLI tool for managing software development templates, designed to
simplify the initial stage of the Software Development Lifecycle. Its main
features include:

1. Downloading and setting up predefined project templates
2. Providing a user-friendly interface
3. Offering speed and efficiency
4. Streamlined CLI commands
5. General-purpose usage

Inspired by tools like Cookiecutter and Create React App (CRA), Terox aims to
enhance user experience without replacing existing solutions.

## Overall Description

### Product Functions

Terox is a cross-platform executable binary access on all major platforms,
namely - Windows, MacOS and Linux. Its primary functionality will involve
fetching project template files from the Internet and downloading them locally
to the user's system. The template files can be stored on remote locations like
GitHub repositories or CDNs hosting the template files in a zipped file.
Additionally, Terox's behaviour is configurable by the user through use of
configuration files.

### User Documentation

The official documentations containing all necessary details about the software
in general is accessible on the site -
[terox.weburz.com](https://terox.weburz.com). Locally accessible
documentations should also be accessible to the users through manpages and help
commands.

## Functional Requirements

Uses of Terox should be able to perform the following tasks while using the
tool:

1. Download and initialise a project based on the content of the downloaded
   template.
2. Allow the user to keep downloaded templates updated with the latest upstream
   changes in the template source.
3. List all locally available templates.
4. Create a new template for future usage.
5. Be able to configure the tool through a standardised configuration file (like
   YAML or JSON files).
